              December 2019 - Graduated from Iowa State University
            </div>
            <div class="textbox-text font-system">
              I graduated from Iowa State University with a BS in Chemical Engineering.
              During my undergraduate studies I managed to maintain a 3.76 GPA.
            </div>
            <div class="textbox-text font-system">
              I participated in various clubs and activities, such as the Society of
              Chemistry Undergraduate Majors (SCUM) and the Iowa State ChemE Car Team.
              I also completed several internships with Grain Processing Corporation
              in Muscatine, Iowa, gaining practical engineering experience in their
              Starch and Alcohol departments.

              All these experiences, combined with my rigorous education, prepared me

              March 2020 - Started working for Tate & Lyle
            </div>
            <div class="textbox-text font-system">
              I began working for Tate & Lyle in the Pilot Plant in Decatur, IL
              as a Production Engineer in early March 2020. About 1 week later,
              the entire world shut down due to COVID-19.
            </div>
            <div class="textbox-text font-system">
              While most of the seasoned engineers began working from home, I continued 
              going into the plant to train and absorb whatever knowledge I could.
            </div>
            <div class="textbox-text font-system">
              I'm now overseeing production, solving day-to-day problems within
              the facility, and specifying and installing new equipment as part of
              continuous improvement to our process. I've also been collaborating
              with Tate & Lyle's scientists to provide technical knowledge for new
              product development.

              May 2022 - Began journey of self-taught programming
            </div>
            <div class="textbox-text font-system">
              In May of 2022 I took an interest in computer science and coding, and
              decided to switch career paths. During the last 14 months I've been
              teaching myself how to write computer programs in my spare time after work
              for roughly 12 - 15 hours every week.
            </div>
            <div class="textbox-text font-system">
              Most of my learning has been accomplished through books, online courses, and
              personal projects. I've completed a certificate for Scientific Computing with Python
              through freeCodeCamp.org, as well as Harvard's CS50x course.
            </div>
            <div class="textbox-text font-system">
              Currently I'm working through The Odin Project, a community-sourced course
              aimed at teaching people how to become fullstack web developers. The tools
              and knowledge I've gained from that course is what I used to create this
              website for myself. I'm proud of how far I've come, and I'm excited to continue
              learning better ways to program!
